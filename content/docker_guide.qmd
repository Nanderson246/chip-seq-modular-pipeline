Docker provides a reproducible, isolated environment for running the pipeline. Once the image is built, the entire analysis can be executed without requiring local software installations.

### ⚙️ Running the Pipeline in Docker

Use the following command to launch the container:

```bash
docker run -v "$PWD:/pipeline2" -w /pipeline2 pipeline2-image \
  bash run_pipeline2.sh [options]
```

This command:

- Mounts your current directory (`$PWD`) into the container at `/pipeline2`
- Sets `/pipeline2` as the working directory
- Executes the pipeline script inside the container

### 📁 Project Structure Inside the Container

Your pipeline files are accessible under:

```
/pipeline2/
├── run_pipeline2.sh
├── modules/pipeline2/
├── metadata/
├── Reference/
├── logs/
├── analysis/
```

Relative paths like `modules/pipeline2/04_run_idr.sh` will resolve correctly.
