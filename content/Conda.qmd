### ✅ 1. `env_pipeline_base.yml` — Core environment

Below are two separate **Conda environment YAML files**:

This includes all necessary packages for running the pipeline in a non-Docker setup, excluding R packages and HOMER.

``` yaml
name: chipseq_pipeline_base
channels:
  - bioconda
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.9
  - pip
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - pyyaml
  - samtools>=1.14
  - bedtools>=2.30.0
  - bwa
  - cutadapt>=4.0
  - macs3
  - deeptools
  - jq
  - r-base=4.2
  - r-data.table
  - r-ggplot2
  - r-dplyr
  - r-readr
  - r-tidyr
  - r-stringr
  - r-jsonlite
  - r-httr
  - r-remotes  # for installing from GitHub
  - pip:
      - idr  # we patch it manually later
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ✅ 2. `env_pipeline_r.yml` — Optional: R + Bioconductor setup

Use this to install additional R packages (run after activating `chipseq_pipeline_base`):

``` r
# In R
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install(c(
  "AnnotationDbi",
  "clusterProfiler",
  "enrichplot",
  "ReactomePA",
  "reactome.db",
  "biomaRt",
  "org.Mm.eg.db",   # for mouse
  "org.Hs.eg.db"    # for human
))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚙️ Software Requirements (Non-Docker Setup)

While this pipeline is fully Docker-compatible, you can also run it natively by installing the required software through **🐍 Conda** and **📘 ℝ** .

### 📁 Environment Files

All environment setup files are located in:

``` bash
env/
├── env_pipeline_base.yml     # Conda YAML file (base system + CLI tools)
├── env_pipeline_r.R          # R script to install required R/Bioconductor packages
```

### 🧪 Step 1: Create Conda Environment

Use the provided YAML file to create a clean Conda environment with all the command-line tools.

``` bash
conda env create -f env/env_pipeline_base.yml
conda activate chipseq_pipeline_base
```

### 📦 Step 2: Install R and Bioconductor Packages

Once inside the conda environment, install the required R packages using:

``` bash
Rscript env/env_pipeline_r.R
```

This script will:

-   Check for missing CRAN or Bioconductor dependencies
-   Install them as needed
-   Load the correct annotation packages for both human (hg38) and mouse (mm10) genomes

### 🧰 Tool Dependencies

Some tools like `picard.jar` and `qualimap` are **not installed via Conda** but are required. These are bundled inside the pipeline under:

``` bash
tools/
├── picard.jar      # Required for BAM metadata tagging
├── qualimap/       # For BAM quality metrics (must be Java-compatible)
```

Make sure:

-   `tools/picard.jar` is accessible (used by `AddOrReplaceReadGroups`)
-   `tools/qualimap/` is executable and on your `PATH` or referenced directly by the scripts

Ensure these are available in your environment or adjust the relevant paths in the pipeline scripts.

🐳 Or Use Docker For reference, installation steps are also reflected in the Dockerfiles:

bash Copy Edit Dockerfile.pipeline1 Dockerfile.pipeline2 These show the exact installation process and can be adapted for manual setup if needed.
