    "text": "2 📋 What is mapping.tsv and Why Is It Important?\n\n2.1 🔍 What is it?\nThe mapping.tsv is a metadata table—a plain text file in tab-separated format—that contains structured information about each sample in your ChIP-seq experiment. Each row represents a sequencing sample, and each column provides key attributes (e.g., sample ID, condition, replicate number, target protein, etc.).\nThis file needs to be stored at:\nmetadata/mapping.tsv\nThis mapping table will be transformed during the pipeline process: at then you will have a backup (mapping.tsv.bak), mapping_filtered.tsv (produce after replicates QC), and mapping_scaled.tsv (produced after bam cleaning, it contains the ratio of exogenous spike , if spike was detected, and the spike genome type).\n\n\n2.2 🧠 Why is it needed?\nThis file is critical for enabling your pipeline to:\n✅ Recognize and organize samples automatically ✅ Group replicates (for IDR and reproducibility checks) ✅ Assign controls (Input, IgG, Mock) correctly for peak calling ✅ Select peak caller styles (e.g., narrowPeak for TFs, broadPeak for histone marks) ✅ Validate input consistency using the YAML schema\nWithout this file, the pipeline wouldn’t know how your samples relate to each other—or how to process them correctly.\n\n\n2.3 🔗 How does the pipeline use it?\n\nPipeline 1: The script 11_Renaming_bam.sh uses the metadata to automatically rename BAM files and organize them into logical groups.\nPipeline 2: Several scripts (e.g., 01_replicate_qc.sh, 03_1_MACS3_peak_calling.sh) read mapping.tsv to apply the right rules for:\n\nSample pairing (ChIP vs. Input)\nReplicate merging\nPeak calling type\nReproducibility evaluation (IDR)\n\nValidation scripts (validate_mapping.py, validate_mapping_yaml.sh) ensure the file is complete and follows strict format rules before any analysis starts.\n\n\n\n2.4 🧬 Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nWhy it matters\n\n\n\n\nAutomation\nRemoves manual handling of sample groups\n\n\nReproducibility\nEnsures the same logic applies every time\n\n\nCompatibility\nLets the pipeline work across diverse experimental designs\n\n\nQuality control\nPrevents broken analyses due to misannotated samples",
