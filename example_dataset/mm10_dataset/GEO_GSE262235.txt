You can get the metadata directly from SRA selector and downlaod the Accession List in the SRR_Acc_List.txt format.
The SRR_Acc_List.txt need to be stored in the package metadata folder and pipeline1 will download the files automatically in the samples folder. This only need to be done once, once in the folder the pipeline will detect the presence against the list and will not repeat the download if samples are already there.

In case you want to use your samples, Upload your samples in the samples folder, the pipeline will detect that there is not a NCBI list,but samples are present in the folder. All samples need to be in the mapping.tsv to be renamed and grouped at the end of the pipeline1 process.

For this example dataset a mapping.tsv and the SRR_Acc_List.txt  are provided in the example folder. 
Please copy the mapping.tsv and the SRR_Acc_List.txt to the metadata folder if you want to run this dataset and test the pipeline

Mice data set
BioProject	PRJNA1090869
Submitted by: Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center
Study: muscle GR epigenomic changes with rs6190 SNP genocopy [ChIP-seq]
Status	Public on Mar 21, 2025
Title	muscle GR epigenomic changes with rs6190 SNP genocopy [ChIP-seq]
Organism	Mus musculus
Experiment type	Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing
Summary	this dataset encompasses the muscle GR epigenomic changes elicited in 4-month-old mice by the rs6190 genocopy allele
 	
Overall design	We compared 4 months-old mice (C57BL/6J background) homozygous for the rs6190 SNP genocopy allele (R24K-homo) vs homozygous for the reference allele (R24K-WT). Quadriceps muscles were collected at ~ZT4 and immediately flash frozen for further processing.
