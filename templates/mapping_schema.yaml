  Metadata table for BAM file renaming in ChIP-seq experiments.
  Required fields: Sample_ID, Sample_Type, Condition, and Target.
  Optional fields such as Replicate, Cell_line, and Instrument will be sanitized and added to filenames if present.
  Note: The 'Replicate' field must not be labeled as 'Input' or left empty. Use proper labels such as 'Rep1', 'Rep2', etc.

required_fields:
  - Sample_ID
  - Instrument
  - Sample_Type
  - Condition
  - Replicate
  - Target
  
optional_fields:
  - Cell_line
  - Spike_Type

field_rules:
  Sample_Type:
    regex: "^Input$|^IP(_rep[0-9]+)?$|^ChIP$"
  Replicate:
    regex: "^[Rr]ep[0-9]+$"

sample_type_rules:
  ip_types:
    - IP
    - ChIP
  control_types:
    - Input
    - IgG
    - Mock

  ============================================================
  Sample_Type accepted entries:
    - IP   : Immunoprecipitation experimental sample
    - ChIP : ChIP-seq experimental sample
    - Input: Control (sonicated DNA without IP)
    - IgG  : Control (non-specific antibody control)
    - Mock : Control (mock treated sample)

  Rules:
    - Target samples must have Sample_Type = "IP" or "ChIP"
    - Control samples must have Sample_Type = "Input", "IgG", or "Mock"
    - Target is now REQUIRED for all samples (including Input).
    - If no control sample exists, peaks will still be called using only IP/ChIP.
  ============================================================
  Field Definitions:
    - Sample_ID: Unique identifier from SRA or your naming system.
    - Sample_Type: Defines whether a sample is 'Input', 'IP', 'ChIP', etc.
    - Instrument: Machine used (e.g., NovaSeq 6000, HiSeq 3000).
    - Target: Target protein, histone mark, or nucleic acid feature (e.g., G4, H3K27ac, 5hmC).
    - Condition: Short biological condition (e.g., WT, BLMneg).
    - Replicate: Biological replicate label, required for proper matching in downstream tools.
        Must follow naming such as 'Rep1', 'rep2', etc.
        Do not use 'Input' or leave blank â€” 'Input' is a Sample_Type, not a replicate.
